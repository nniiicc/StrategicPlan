This document describes the way that I use Github (and its various tracking features) to organize my research, teaching, and service work. My goal is to document some of the assumptions I have made in developing this method, and to make clear to my group (and myself) what I am doing for the sake of accountability. 

### Why use Github for Strategic Planning? 
Github is built on top of the version control scheme git - which enables distributed software teams to maintain reliable tracking and provenance of a codebase. 

Being a platform for collaborative software development there are a number of valuable features for planning and tracking a project. I've mostly coopted these in order to plan research, and increasingly I've started to use these features for teaching and service work as well. 
 
### My Method
Each time I begin a new project I start a new repository. In some cases I may be collaborating on work and so I will contribute to other people's repositories or start a new organization. 

For each task related to a project I assign an `issue` - which allows me to name the task as well as leave any notes about progress I've made, blockers I have, or thoughts I have about how to execute the task. A helpful feature in github is that you can create checklists in your issues  - so I often use this to list out a set of things I want to do related to a task and tick those off as the day goes on. 

I also use `tags` as a way to sort and quickly identify similar tasks related to a single project. 

After I have mapped out a set of issues for a repository I then create a `milestone`. A milestone is a group of issues that have are assigned to a person (me) and have deliverable date. 

At this point  - an example will probably be helfpul. 

I have a repository for a paper that I plan to submit to a special issue of the Data Science Journal (DSJ). I have already submitted an abstract, and given a presentation on this research so I have a good starting base. I created a repository where I have put my working draft of the paper, my previous abstract, and my presentation slides. I also started to map out a set of issues (tasks) that I know I need to accomplish before the paper is ready for submission. I assigned these tasks to a milestone called [Paper Submission](). Since this is a special edition of the Journal it also has a due date - June 30th. 

### Turning Issues into a Strategic Plan 
The NCFDD - Faculty Success program recommends creating a strategic plan that connects your research and writing to a timeline. The goal of this process is to create clear deadlines for accountability, and help faculty to be realistic about what (or even how many) tasks need to be accomplished over a given period of time. 

My method, described above, is great for in-depth planning of a single project, but is not very conducive to working across projects. 

To try to create a better holistic strategic plan I am doing two things: 
1. I crated a new repository (this) that is dedicated solely to strategic planning. In this repository I will write a 12 week plan based on all of the things I hope to accomplish over that period. I will include links to milestones within that plan so that I have a clear idea of what is due, when, and what issues are related to that milestone. 
2. I am going to use the `Project` feature to organize each week of activities. This allows me to see all the issues that I have to accomplish in a given week, and to track my progress each week related to those issues. My first week is located here.
